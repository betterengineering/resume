# Small Hold

Hi y'all,

I'm writing to apply for the Director of Software position within your Engineering group. Given my background and expertise I'm uniquely qualified to help Small Hold grow it's hyper local urban agriculture business. 

Why Small Hold?

Food is at the basis of human connection and culture. It's how we connect, relate, and come together. As we confront what urban areas need such that we can sustain life on this planet far into the future, urban agriculture sits on the forefront. The more efficient our food is, the more efficient we are. 

Small Hold is putting action first and taking a step to realize that vision by providing a sustainable and delicious food source for urban populations. This mission is something I want to help fulfill. 

Why Gabe Ochoa for Small Hold?

Over the last 15 years I've worked on projects that include battle bots, a video TV portal for our aging population, IoT hubs and air conditioners, consumer electronics, raspberry Pi environmental sensors, physical data centers that run a portion of the internet, and electric cargo bicycles. What do these all have in common? They're at the intersection between the physical and digital world. Our physical world shouldn't, and can't, be ignored. Bringing digital tools to help build solutions for physical problems is what I'm passionate about.

Small Hold fits this passion and experience. The work to create efficient and automated urban farms is a perfect place to leverage my IoT experience from Wink, the capacity and networking experience from Squarespace, and the theoretical concepts from my mechanical engineering degree. 

I look forward to the possibility of talking more about this role soon.

Thank you,
Gabe Ochoa
